# EMTCT Project Readme

## Overview

EMTCT (Elimination of Mother-To-Child Transmission) is a project aimed at reducing seroconversion among HIV-exposed infants. Seroconversion refers to the development of specific antibodies in the blood as a result of infection or immunization. In the context of HIV, it refers to the transition from being HIV-negative to HIV-positive.

## Project Aims

The primary goal of EMTCT is to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. By implementing early interventions and effective strategies, we aim to significantly reduce the risk of seroconversion among infants born to HIV-positive mothers.

## Contribution to Ending HIV in Children

EMTCT aligns with the broader vision of ending HIV in children. By focusing on preventing transmission from infected mothers to their babies, we contribute to breaking the cycle of HIV transmission. By providing timely interventions and support, we aspire to create a future where no child is born with HIV.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: EMTCT is built using the Laravel framework, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for web application development.
- **MySQL**: The project utilizes MySQL as the database management system to store and manage data efficiently.
- **Machine Learning**: EMTCT incorporates a machine learning section where predictive models are trained to forecast the likelihood of seroconversion in HIV-exposed infants. This predictive capability enables healthcare professionals to intervene earlier and implement preventive measures, ultimately reducing the risk of seroconversion.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the EMTCT project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olochom/Emtct.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
